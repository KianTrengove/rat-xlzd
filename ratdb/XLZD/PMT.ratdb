//cuboid: self-explanatory (cube)
//LAPPD: was made for 1 specific PMT,  we don't need to consider it

//the documentation for how the toroidal pmts are constructed is completely absent.
//so I've just done my best by following ToroidalPMTContruction.cc
//dynode stuff is mostly self-evident

//z_edge, rho_edge, and z_origin, seem to be so that you can construct different layers, with each layer being a column

dynode_radius: 23.0, // mm - just a guess
dynode_top:   -30.0, // mm - just a guess
wall_thickness: 1.0, // mm - just a guess

z_edge:   [ 4.020, 1.00,   0.00, -16.75, -30.00, -32.00, -119.0], // mm - just a guess
rho_edge: [ 38.0 ,	38.0, 38.0,  38.0, 26.65, 26.65, 26.65],  // mm - just a guess
z_origin: [ 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], // mm - just a guess - 
//Being honest, I still don't really understand the z_edge and z_origin options and still need to research them more
//I copied the z values from a similiarly shaped pmt that rat already has
//I've yet to find an instance where z_origin changes teh geometry, so I just set them all to 0
//Changing z_edge in almost any way has a habit of resulting in a crash

noise_rate: 10000.0, // Hz - Just a guess
